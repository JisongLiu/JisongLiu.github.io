### AKKA 

Akka is used for parallel and concurrency. One important feature of it is actor-model

Pros of actor model:
- Event-driven model Communication between Actors is asynchronous, allowing Actors to send messages and continue their own work without blocking.
- Strong isolation principles. They don't expose any API you can invoke. The only way you can use is sending message to ask its state
- Location transparency Actor instances can start, stop, move, and restart to scale up and down as well as recover from unexpected failures.
- Lightweight â€” Each instance consumes only a few hundred bytes, which realistically allows millions of concurrent Actors to exist in a single application

### How to implement a pagination of Database

- Database-driven pagination, without result set caching -> everytime you query, for example: 0 - 50 or 51 - 100 will get the same result

- Database-driven pagination, with result set caching in memory

- Middle-tier-driven pagination (help avoid the too many hits on database, it is useful when the search query is rigid)
- Front-End pagination 
- Interface: given a beginning link and an end link; given next and pre link; -> the position of a page start
